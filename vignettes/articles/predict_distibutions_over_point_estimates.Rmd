## Working with Distribution Objects

### What is a distribution object?

### What operations can we perform on a distribution object?

### How can we include distribution objects in our current workflow?

<!-- * distribution objects can be represented in one column of data.frame -->

<!-- * purrr/dplyr operations on a column (e.g. taking the mean as a point estimate) -->
